    "This SageMath code computes the cohomology groups of real flag manifolds. The computations are based on the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11149.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `load(\"real_flag.sage\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `D = [2, 3, 4]`  or any dimension vector\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `F = flagcomplex(D)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates the data structure of a flagcomplex and prints generators of its rational cohomology. It will save the output to a file, by using the optional argument `writetofile = True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `flagcomplex` has the following fields:\n",
    "* `D`: the differences in dimensions in $\\operatorname{Fl}_D$\n",
    "\n",
    "* `S`: the dimensions in $\\operatorname{Fl}_D$, starts by 0 for indexing reasons\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Q`: the dimensions of the quotient subspaces\n",
    "\n",
    "* `dim`: dimension of $\\operatorname{Fl}_D$ as manifold\n",
    "\n",
    "* `vertices`: a dictionary, indexed by Permutations. For example, `vertices[Permutation([1,3,2])]` corresponds to a `Schubertcell` type data, see later.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `codimdictionary`: a nested dictionary, indexed by integers (the codimension). Each entry is a dictionary, such that `codimdictionary[c][s]` is the `s`'th Schubertcell type object of codimension `c` (some ordering). This ordering is used in the homology computation.\n",
    "                \n",
    "* `incidencematrices`: a list of matrices, the incidence matrices of the Schubert cells. `incidencematrices[c]` is the incidencematrix between codim c and c+1. The indexing in each matrix is the one used in codimdictionary.\n",

    "__Auxiliary fields:__\n",
    "* `nextblock`: dictionary, for position i, nextblock[i] is the starting position of the next block in osp\n",
    "\n",
    "* `blockid[i]` returns the number of the block in which position i falls\n",

    "    Creates the data structure of a `flagcomplex`:\n",
    "  - initializes `F.vertices` (a dictionary mapping `Permutation`s to `Schubertcell`s) \n",

    "  - the Bruhat graph of Schubert cells (see `Schubertcell.inneighbors`, `Schubertcell.outneighbors`)\n",

    "  - optional arguments `verbose, writetofile, computecohomology` should be clear.\n",

    "* `get_codimcells(c)`: returns a list of OSPs, which are of codimension c.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `compute_incidencematrices(verbose = False)`: computes sign of each incidence, saves them in two places:\n",
    "  - the respective Schubertcell neighbors\n",
    "  - generates the incidencematrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `compute_cohomology(verbose = False)`: computes the cohomology using SageMath's homology package.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `print_generators(writetofile = False)`: print generators of cohomology \n",
    "    - if optional argument `writetofile = True`, saves output to a file in Sage's current working folder. \n",

    "* `inneighbors`: a dictionary of the cells whose closure contains Schubertcell. \n",
    "* `outneighbors`: a dictionary of the cells contained in the closure of Schubertcell.\n",
    "  - These dictionaries have keys `id`, `a`, `b`, `alpha`, `beta`, `incident`, `weight`:\n",

    "    - If incident, `weight` is the +-2 incidence coefficient, otherwise not defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Auxiliary fields:__    \n",
    "* `GI`, `LI`: dictionaries mapping each `i=-m,...,m-1` to a list of integers. The integers equal the number of elements greater than `I[k]`, at least `i` blocks away. These are used in `Schubertcell.get_GI()`.\n",
